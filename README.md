# Product between matrices
This is a simple project to calculate the result of multiplying two Matrices. The main goal of it was to make sure that I learned its concepts of it.

## Usage
Install the dependency (readline-sync) and run main.js with NodeJs

I also think a better implementation could be done with typescript but this was a simple and short thing to do.
